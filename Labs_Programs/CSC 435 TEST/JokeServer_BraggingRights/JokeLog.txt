User logs in with email address and name.  User gets 2 jokes, the admin is switched to proverb mode and gets 2 more jokes, and again to proverb mode to get 3 more proverbs.

Note that the when the first joke is sent, the user is assigned a UUID that is used in subsequent requests.  That is, UUID is not generated each time, rather, it is looked up from the saved state.  

When the user switches to the secondary server, a new UUID is generated and is used for the subsequent jokes and proverbs
