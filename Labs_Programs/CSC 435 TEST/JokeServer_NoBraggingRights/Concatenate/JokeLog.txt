User only connected to primary server only type ’s’ to toggle to secondary 
and gets a message that no secondary is available.  Note that output from
user Bob’s session was captured after parts A, B, C were completed so his
session is in proverb mode.  (Part C does not affect this user since he is 
only connected to the primary server)

Part A. Output shows client connected to primary and secondary server with 8 output responses in 
joke mode and 8 responses in proverb mode. The first four jokes sent were JD, JC, JB, JA are 
sent and now that all four have been used, they may be reused. The next four that are sent
are JA, JB, JC, JD.  

The JokeClientAdmin switches to proverb mode and four proverbs are sent.  PB, PA, PC, PD and
since all four have been sent, they may be reused.  The next four sent are PD, PB, PC, PA.

B. User then enters ’s’ and is toggled to the secondary server, and the JokeClientAdmin 
changes to secondary as well.

C. Repeat part A for the secondary server
