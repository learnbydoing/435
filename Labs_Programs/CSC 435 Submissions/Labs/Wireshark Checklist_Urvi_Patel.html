<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lab 1 - Intro<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I installed Wireshark on a Mac and went through the exercises in the lab.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This entailed starting up Wireshark and going to a specified website and displaying a page in the browser.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once the page was displayed, I stopped the Wireshark capture and figured out the answers to the questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Namely, they wanted 3 protocols that appeared in the protocol column, (TCP, HTTP, DNS) the time between the HTTP GET and OK messages, and the IP addresss of the website visited. This was done by looking at the Wireshark’s packet listing window.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
Lab 2 - IP<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">On the Mac, I started up a Wireshark capture and ran 3 traceroute commands, with lengths of 56 bytes, 2000 bytes, and 3500 bytes, respectively, and then turned off the Wireshark capture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then found the answers to my questions in the capture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This entailed find the protocol used (it was UDP since this was a Mac, as stated in the lab description).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also looked at the header and fields in the header, made note of whether the datagram was fragmented, how many fragments there were when traceroute was run with a parameter of 2000 bytes and a parameter of 3500 bytes<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and the fields that change (or do not change) from one fragment to the next. (There were 2 and 3 fragments, respectively).</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lab 3 - DNS</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I installed Wireshark on a Windows 10 PC.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I ran ipconfig /all, ipconfig /displaydns and ipconfig /flushdns as indicated in the exercies. <br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I started another capture and ran nslookup www.ittd.ac.in to find a server in Asia, and noted the IP address of that server.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I noticed that the DNS server was given as “UnKnown”. This is because the router uses our internet provider’s DNS so we only know the router’s IP address.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From my perspective, I can use the router as the DNS server. I then ran nslookup -type=NS www.ucm.es (for a server in Europe).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I tried to run nslookup mail.yahoo.com &lt;DNS server&gt; with one of the name servers for ucm.es but I received a “Query refused” message.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After clearing the dns and browser cache, I started a Wireshark capture. I then visited http://www.ietf.org, and then stopped the capture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then went through the questions which consisted of finding source/destination IP addresses and ports in the packet listing window.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I checked the fields to look for any ‘answers’ in the query and response messages, as well as what the ‘answers’ contained.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I then ran nslookup www.mit.edu and noticed that they ipv4 as well as ipv6 servers. I noted the destination/source ports for the query and response for the ipv4 and ipv6 servers. I also compared the destination address to that in the ipconfig command to verify that the destination was indeed my DNS server’s IP address (i.e., my router address).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked at the message type for DNS query and for the response, I looked at the ’answers’ fields, and what the ’answers’ contained.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lastly, I ran nslookup -type=NS mit.edu. I again noted the destination IP address of the DNS query and compared it to ipconfig output to verify that it was indeed sent to my DNS server (i.e., router).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked at the DNS query’s message type and the nameservers (and their IP addresses) in the response message</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lab 4 - HTTP</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Started a capture and went to the website in the lab exercises to get a simple file, (waiting the full minute to actually download it as instructed), then stopped the capture and went throught the questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I noted the version the browser and server were running, my IP address, the server IP address, the languages accepted, and how many bytes of content are returned.<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Next, I started a capture and went to a website and got a second file and refreshed the page, and then stopped the capture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then checked the HTTP GET messages and noted that there was no “IF-MODIFIED-SINCE” lin in the first GET, but there was in the second GET. Also, the response status code for the second get was 304 and the Response Phrase was “Not Modified”.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I found the contents of the file by expanded the “Line based text data” section.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I started another capture and went to a website to retrieve a large file, and stopped the capture. I noted how many GET messages were sent, and response status code and response phrase, and the number of segments needed to carry the response.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I started another capture and went to a website to retrieve a file with mulitple images, and stopped the capture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I noticed that the browser sent 2 GET messages for /~kurose/cover_5th_ed.jpg. The first GET had a response of "302 Found", which upon researching (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302) means that there was a redirect. Under the "Line-based text data" section is the html for the webpage it went to first, namely, "http://manic.cs.umass.edu/~kurose/cover_5th_ed.jpg", which contains a message that the document has moved to http://caite.cs.umass.edu/~kurose/cover_5th_ed_jpg.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As expected, this was the URI for the second GET.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also looked at timestamps for the GETs and OKs and it appeared to me that the messages were being downloaded serially.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lastly, I cleared the browser cache and restarted the browser. I then started another capture and went to a website to retrieve a password protected page, and stopped the capture. I noted the response status code and phrase for the first HTTP GET was “401” and “Unauthorized”, respectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also noted that there was an “Authorization” field in the second GET but not the first.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lab 5 - TCP<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I started up my browser and went to a website to download the text to ‘Alice in Wonderland’ and saved it on my computer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then went to another website that allowed by to upload the file. I started a capture and then hit “Upload” button. Once the upload was complete, I stopped the capture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then went through the questions, noting the IP address and port number used by my computer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then filtered the packets for TCP messages only and looked at the sequence number of the TCP SYN segments, as well as the Flags field to see that the SYN and Acknowledgement flags were set for the SYNACK segment. I looked throught the segments and found the one that contained the POST command by checking the raw data.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then selected a segment and created a Time Sequence graph using Wirehark’s graphing capabilities and noticed that the function was increasing and showed the slow start phase.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I noticed that the lengths of 4 of the 6 TCP segments were much greater than 1460. According to footnote #4 in the lab description, this meant that Wireshark was reporting an incorrect number, showing one large TCP segment instead of smaller segments. It also suggested using their trace file. However, I continued on with the capture file I created for the rest of the questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I determined that there were not any retransmitted segments, since the Time Sequence graph was an increasing function. I also looked at the packet listing window and calculated the estimate RTT after the receipt of each ACK.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lab 6 - UDP<br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I started capturing UDP packets on my network and looked at a the information collected by Wireshark for UDP packet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This was done by inspecting the Wireshark packet listing and packet detail windows. Namely, I noted the length of the fields in the UDP header, interpolated the length of the payload based on the header length and total length, noted that the protocol number for UDP is 17 and calculated the larget port number that was available. I then looked at a pair of UDP packets where the first packet is the one my computer sends and the second it its reply.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I noticed that the source port of the first packet is the same as the destination port of second packet and the destination port of the first packet is the same as the source port of second packet.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lab 7 - SSL</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I started a Wireshark capture and went to amazon.com and started to go through the motions of purchasing an item.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right before checkout, I exited the site and stopped the capture.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then went through the exercises to learn about the trace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I made note of the first 8 Ethernet frames and the SSL records in each, the size of the fields at the beginning of each of the SSL records.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After this, I went through each type of record and explored them, as indicated by the lab questions. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For the ClientHello record, I noted that the Content Type was Handshake, and that it did contain a nonce, which was in the “Random” field.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also noted the hexidecimal value of the nonce.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I also looked at the cipher suites that were supported and noted that the first was TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For the ServerHello record, I noted which cipher suite the server chose (from the list the client sent in the ClientHello record) and it was TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA25. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
